## ✅ What I Already Knew or Now Understand Well

### 🔧 Git vs GitHub

* **Git** is a distributed version control system I use locally to track changes to my code.
* **GitHub** is the platform where I can store my Git repositories online, collaborate with others, and manage project history.

### 🧠 Key Concepts I’ve Grasped

* **Repositories**: I now understand that a repository is like a project folder. It stores all my files and their revision history.
* **Cloning**: I can clone a repository from GitHub to my computer to work locally and sync changes with the cloud.
* **Committing & Pushing**: I can make commits to track changes and push them to GitHub to share with my team or instructor.
* **Branches**: I can create branches to work on features or experiments separately from the main code.
* **Pull Requests**: I know how to open a pull request to propose changes, get feedback, and eventually merge them.
* **Forks**: I understand that forking allows me to experiment on someone else’s project without affecting the original.
* **Issues**: I can create issues to track bugs, tasks, or ideas within a project.
* **Markdown**: I can format my README, issues, and pull requests using Markdown for better readability.



## 🌱 What’s New to Me

### 🧭 GitHub Explore

* GitHub Explore is totally new to me!
  * I learned that I can discover new projects, developers, and events at [github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore).
* **Profile README**: I can customize my GitHub profile with a README to tell others who I am and showcase my work.
